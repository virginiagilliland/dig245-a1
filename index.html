  I am taking this class because I enjoy taking skills and application based classes.
  I and am excited to sharpen my coding skills while learning about web design.
  I am really enjoeyed surveillance culture and am thinking of becoming a
  dig studies minor.
  <br></br>
  I do not have experience creating content for the web... aside from the
  occasional instagram post, although i'm betting that is not what you are going
  for here.  I do have some previous programming experience. I took bioinformatics
  which is CSC 121 but with bio related homeworks. Our final project was to
  create an app. I also took biostats which uses R.

  <br>My Goals for the Course:</br>
      1. understand the process of designing a website
      2. feel confident in my ability to code in the languages we learn
  `   3. develop creatively

<br></br>
Projects I consider Interesting:
    1. Hiking project - https://www.hikingproject.com/. Also an app, this
    site is remarkable because it lets users find hikes in their area or across
    the country. If a route doesn't exist yet, users can input their own.
    The site is quite interactive and satisfying with the colors/nature vibe.
    I enjoy hiking and like it for the usability and accessibility.
    2. Diversify EEB - https://diversifyeeb.com/. I learned about this project in
    Ecology this week. On this site, people from underrepresented groups can
    sumbit their publications and get added to a database. Others can use the
    database to interact with and promote science from diverse groups. This is
    especially culturally relevant given lack of representation of minority
    groups in science.
    3. MapMyRide - https://www.mapmyride.com/us/. Although everytime I use this
    app I think of discussions we had in surveillance culture, it is quite
    useful for tracking mileage when exercising. I like the visuals and graphs
    it provides to compare variations and total mileage throughout the week.
